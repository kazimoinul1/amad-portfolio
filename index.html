In this study, Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) tests were performed on 12 asphalt pavement sections in South Carolina to estimate the resilient modulus (MR) of the subgrade soil using three back-calculation tools: BAKFAA, SCDOT Program, and AASHTOWare. </p>

The data obtained from these methods were used to study the feasibility of using the subgrade MR found from the FWD test to subdivide pavement sections (ranging in length from 2 to 40 km) into multiple, shorter pavement sections for use in the local calibration of the MEPDG.  In South Carolina, the number of pavement sections with data available for local calibration is limited, thus subdividing the pavement sections based on changes in material properties will help increase the number of pavement sections for local calibration (30 sections are recommended in the MEPDG Design Guide).  </p>

Based on findings from the FWD testing, 4 of the sections exhibited 2 different MR profiles, 1 section exhibited 3 different MR profiles, and 7 sections had relatively constant MR profiles along the length of the sections.  Thus, 6 additional sections have been identified. Work is ongoing to analyze additional data to identify additional pavement sections.</p>

Resilient modulus is a fundamental property to characterize unbound subgrade material. </p>
